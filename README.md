# Unexpected Tailwind CSS Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Tailwind CSS where a background color doesn't render properly. The issue is related to the way Tailwind processes styles in combination with other CSS properties or conflicting class names. 

## Bug Description

A container with a defined background color in Tailwind CSS does not display the expected background. This may be due to unexpected CSS specificity or conflicting class names. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run npm start to start the development server.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying and resolving the conflict in the CSS. This could involve tweaking class names, adjusting the order of classes, or adding !important flags (as a last resort). The solution file demonstrates the correct implementation with explanation in the code comments.
